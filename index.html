        <p>
          On a sunny December afternoon, the most challenging part of reaching Governors Island was simply finding the ferry. There were no signs or staff, and the Staten Island Ferry was the only obvious terminal, leaving many to rely on their phones to figure out where to stand. When the Governors Island boat arrived, no one checked tickets. A crew member waved passengers forward. About 30 people boarded the 12:30 crossing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stepping off the ferry felt like entering another world. The air was crisp and clean. Helicopters moved overhead every 15 minutes. The fields were empty. The quiet feels unusual for New York, but also unexpectedly calming.
        </p>

        <p class="nut-graf">
          Governors Island brings in close to a million people every year, but winter is different. When the warm season ends and most activities shut down, a smaller community keeps it going: students who travel for school, construction workers who build in the cold, ferry crews who connect the island to lower Manhattan, and visitors searching for peace or a moment they will remember. Together they show what life on the island looks like when the crowds are gone.

        <p>
          New York Harbor School is the busiest place in winter. The public high school enrolls 496 students, and their routine continues through every season. Students move through hands-on work outdoors, welding metal, hauling barrels of dirt and debris, and carrying equipment across the feild without slowing down.
        </p>

        <p>
          “It’s a bit cold. It’s not too bad,” said junior Nathan Duffy, who travels from Queens and has grown used to the ferry ride. Another student, Yasmin, described her commute with one word. “Cold,” she said, then shrugged. “You just get used to it.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Their movement brings steady life to an island that otherwise falls quiet.

        <p>
          Near the school, crews are working on a new Harbor School facility that will include a twelve-foot-deep swimming pool for scuba and water training. Work continues even as temperatures drop.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Governor’s Island has its own weather channel,” said Mike, a construction laborer. “It is always windy, and it is always cold.”
        </p>

        <p>
          He sets up barricades and scaffolding and keeps the area safe. Most winter days, the only people who pass the construction zone are students. Many of the old Coast Guard buildings nearby remain closed, adding to the stillness. The construction crews supply much of the island’s winter activity as they push long-term projects forward.

        <h2>Ferry workers who keep the island connected</h2>

        </figure>

        <p>
          The ferry is the only way in and out. Service begins at 7 a.m. and continues late into the evening for tenants and registered guests. A new electric vessel now serves the route, and the crew takes pride in the shift to cleaner operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          “This vessel is electrical. It does not need the type of maintenance a traditional vessel needs,” said Hamilton, an oiler who has spent forty years in marine engineering. He described the ship as quieter, cleaner, and reliably heated during winter. After two years working on Governors Island, he plans to retire and return to Trinidad. The cold has taken a toll.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ferry crews are the backbone of daily life, ensuring the island runs through every season.

        <h2>Vendors who stay open when most do not</h2>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Most food stands close for the winter, but Makina Café remains open and serves Ethiopian and Eritrean dishes. Kevin, who works there, explained that staying open year-round is easier than training new staff each spring.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Right now, not many people come,” Kevin said. “In the summer, it is about four or five thousand people a week.”
        </p>

        <p>
          In winter, the stand mainly serves students, construction workers, and spa visitors. Joe Coffee at the ferry landing keeps morning hours and completes the small but steady winter food scene.

          QC NY Spa stays open year-round, its outdoor pools steaming against the cold air. Visitors come for quiet, warmth, and views of the Statue of Liberty.

        <p>
          “It is beautiful,” said Lena from Williamsburg. “It is so empty. A little mysterious.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Her partner described the challenge of reaching the island in winter. “There was no sign. We had to follow the map.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Other visitors come for something more personal. On October 11, Andrew Valavan proposed to his fiancée on Outlook Hill, one of the island’s highest points.
        </p>

        <p>
          “In the five boroughs, it is hard to find a spot where you can be alone,” he said. “This was one of the only places where we could get a private moment.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Clouds covered the sky that day, but the moment stayed memorable. As they walked toward the hill, a fire department boat sprayed water into the harbor, a sight Valavan said he will never forget.

          <span>7 a.m. — First ferry</span>
          <span>6 p.m. — Last ferry from Governors Island</span>
        </div>

        <h2>An island that slows down but never stops</h2>

        <p>
          By late afternoon around 4 p.m., temperatures fell as the sun drifted lower. The island grew quieter. Empty fields, shuttered houses, and old barracks sat still in the fading light.
        </p>

        <p>
          Arts programs close from November to April. Historic sites open only by appointment. The Urban Farm welcomes visitors solely on weekends.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even so, a small community continues to move across the island. Students heading to and from class. Construction crews working in the wind. Ferry workers keeping the schedule running. Vendors serving whoever arrives. Visitors seeking peace, reflection, or a private moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Winter changes the pace of Governors Island, but it does not stop it. The people who show up in the cold bring life to this place long after summer ends.
        </p>

        <p class="closing-line">
          They are the winter people.
